Kitsch is others’ (inevitably weird or disgusting) enjoyment objects, evoking the intrinsically nonhuman aspect of enjoyment as such. “How on Earth could so many people want a snow globe of Gandalf ?” But this gives rise to a very valuable insight. Even when I am having it, enjoyment isn’t “mine.” It exceeds my conceptual grasp. I’m sorry to break it to the avant-garde, but art, in an ecological age, will melt into kitsch because there will be no single, authoritative scale from which to judge. To accommodate this will require a major revaluation of kitsch, salvaging it from its trashy category as a trash can for things we think of as fascist or otherwise beyond the pale. The prethereotical rejection of symbolism in theory class will need to explain itself without resorting to knee-jerk disgust. The unshocking idea that art should shock the bourgeoisie out of its complacency is what needs to be gently folded and put away. Again, the chemistry of consumerism should not be rejected, because it is consumerism that opens the world of kitsch.
